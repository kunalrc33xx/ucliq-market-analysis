## 📄 Executive Summary
**Context:** Ucliq is a B2B e-commerce platform connecting farmers/wholesalers with retailers and restaurants.
**The Challenge:** Despite growth, the platform faced undefined bottlenecks in customer retention and operational consistency.
**The Project:** Conducted a comprehensive market research study (N=50) across Delhi/NCR to identify pain points in the "Farm-to-Fork" supply chain.

**Key Impact:**
* Identified that **60% of deliveries were inconsistent**, leading to a recommendation for a logistics overhaul.
* Uncovered a critical quality control issue where **18% of dissatisfied clients** cited "Excessive Preservatives" (Potassium Nitrite), prompting a supply chain audit.
* Validated the roadmap for a mobile app, as **40% of the target market** still preferred offline procurement but showed willingness to digitize.

## Key Insights & Visualizations
*Analysis generated using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) based on survey data.*

### 1. Product Quality: The "Preservative" Problem
While 61% of users were satisfied, the primary driver for churn was product quality. Specifically, **18% of complaints** were linked to the use of *Potassium Nitrite*, a finding that directly influenced procurement standards.

### 2. Operational Gap: Delivery Inconsistency
Logistics reliability was identified as the biggest operational weakness. Only **35%** of B2B clients received products quickly *consistently*, while **60%** reported "Sometimes" receiving them on time.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the data, the following strategic pivots were proposed to leadership:

1.  **Supply Chain Audit (Health Focus):**
    * **Finding:** High concern regarding preservatives.
    * **Action:** Reduce reliance on chemical preservatives like Potassium Nitrite to align with the "Fresh" value proposition.

2.  **Logistics Optimization:**
    * **Finding:** 60% inconsistency rate in delivery.
    * **Action:** Standardize delivery fleets to ensure reliable timing, which is critical for B2B restaurant clients.

3.  **Digital Transformation (App Development):**
    * **Finding:** 40% of the user base still relies on offline channels.
    * **Action:** Develop a mobile app to bridge the gap and capture the remaining offline market share.
